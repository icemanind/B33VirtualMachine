; This sample will show you how to
; simply load a register with a decimal
; value. We are going to load
; the A register with 65 and load the
; B register with hex $45. Note the
; pound sign (#), which means load
; the register with the value
; immediately following the pound sign
start       lda         #65                     ; Load A register with 65
            ldb         #$45                    ; Load B register with hex 45 (0x45)
            ldx         #%1010100000000         ; Load X register with binary value (0x1500)
            end         start
