; This program will simply load data
; from a memory address into the A register.
; It will load whatever data is contained
; at address hex $1000 into the A register.
; It will then load whatever data is contained
; at address 8192 (decimal 8192) into the 
; B register
start       lda         $1000       ; Load A with the data contained at address 0x1000
            ldb         8192        ; Load B with the data contained at address 8192
