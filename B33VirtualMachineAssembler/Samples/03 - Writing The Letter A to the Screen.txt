; This program simply puts an
; 'A' in the upper left hand corner
; of the screen. It first loads
; the A register with 65, which is
; the ASCII code for an 'A'. It then
; stores that letter at $e000, which
; is the beginning of the video memory.
Start       lda         #65         ; Load A register with 65 (ASCII 'A')
            sta         $e000       ; Store the value of A at memory location 0xE000 (the virtual screen)
            end         Start
